## API Documentation

### Automatic updates

These steps assume it's time for an update

#### Windows

- Download the new game executable, `game.exe`, for the release into the
  `updates` directory inside the save directory under new names
- Move active game file to a `oldgame.exe`, also inside the `updates` directory
- Now move the downloaded `game.exe` into the same place when the game was
  launched.
- Relaunch the game

#### OSX 

- Download the latest zipped app
- Unzip the app into the save game directory
- Remove the current app
- Move the freshly downloaded app to the old location
- Open it up

### appcast.json

The SDK checks for updates by requesting a JSON appcast from StackMachine

```js
{
